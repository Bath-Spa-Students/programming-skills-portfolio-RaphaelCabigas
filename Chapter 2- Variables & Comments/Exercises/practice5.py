# Write a python program that stores fruit names in a list named fruits. Unpack the list into three
# variables x, y and z and then print the values of each variable.

# a fruits list that stores strings of fruit names
fruits = ["mango", "coconut", "apple"]

# x, y, z variables stores each fruit names in the fruits list with their corresponding positive index number
x = fruits[0]
y = fruits[1]
z = fruits[2]

# prints the values of x, y, z variables
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
